The show is incredibly well made. Shouts out to the writer, director, cast and crew. I didnt expect it to be this good in fact i tried to have no expectations at all for it because i didnt want to be dissapointed. At first i didnt think henry would be a good fit for geralt but the more and more i watched him as geralt the more i believed he was geralt, in other words he sold me as being geralt. Which is pretty impressive considering i had the game geralts voice and appearance stuck in my head. The actress who played yennefer was incredible too. I felt for her so much when she was a cripple, she played the battered abused role well (it was extremely believable), and she played the fierce unapologetic yennefer really well too. The actress for ciri was a great choice, she truly looks the part and i really am dreading whats to come for her in the upcoming seasons cuz ciri goes through a lot. There's just so much to get into, the cinematography was effing amazing. The monsters looked groutesque especially the ghouls!! We need to see more monsters! Yeah yeah ik the books focus on more then just monsters but they did such a great job with them that i wanna see more. Music on point, jaskier was good too. Battle of sodden hill was insane. They really captured the atmosphere and grittyness of the world of witcher. S02 is gonna get even uglier tho, and i cant effing wait! Anyways the show is so good that i once i finished reading the last wish again im gonna rewatch, also cant forget about the fight scenes the fight scenes were incredible!!! Good job Henry camvil for doing your own stunts. Incredible!!!! I need 10 seasons of this show, go farther then got!!!!
